# Kepler-26-Exo-System-Simulation

This project shows the simulation of the Kepler 26 Exo-System, achieved through the utilization of the
VPython. Within this simulation, viewers can witness the dynamic and intricate movements of celestial
bodies within this distant planetary system. The virtual representation provides an immersive experience,
enabling users to explore the orbits and interactions of planets, shedding light on the fascinating dance of
celestial bodies in the Kepler 26 Exo-System.
